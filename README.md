# Fibonacci Algorithms Comparison

## Description
This project implements and compares various techniques to compute Fibonacci numbers. The goal is to analyze their efficiency and determine the most optimized approach.

## Implemented Methods
- âœ… Naive Recursion 
- âœ… Memoization  
- âœ… Tabulation
- âœ… Optimized 3 Variable  
- âœ… Matrix Exponentiation  
- âœ… Binetâ€™s Formula  

## Benchmarking
Each method is timed to measure performance differences, helping to identify the most efficient algorithm.
Results are stored in results.json with proper formatting.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang, MSVC)
- CMake (optional, for build automation)

### Compilation & Execution
To compile:
```sh
g++ -o fibonacci main.cpp -O2
```
